This is a progress log, since this project can still be improved

So far
-move is done at random as long as the coordinates don't break out of the grid
-it needs to be more "aware", if there is another object near it
example, if a plant is in range, the herbivore should eat it
-some form of object detection is needed


-laying some foundation down
-going to brute force it, as I can't come up with a nice algorithm
-have a switch for the all possible movements
-restrict movement by finding the object's location on the grid
-now implement

-messing with the grid, remember to change it back
-in the environment file and organism (getrand)
