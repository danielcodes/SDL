This is a progress log, since this project can still be improved

So far
-function that finds location
-function that moves within a radius

what needs to be done
-combine the two above functions, based on a found location, get back the available moves
-example, top left corner can only go right, down and bot-right

--fixes needed
the function that returns an array, bug with implementation

things that need to be put back in place
-messing with the grid, remember to change it back
-in the environment file and organism (getrand)
