Some insight on the project

Virtual Environment
-a 2D plane, 32x32
-four types of objects, herbivore, carnivore, plant and obstacles
-program runs, # of objects of each type
-herbivore eats plants, carnivore eats herbivore
-animals and plants have age, only animals have energy
-can die if there isn't enough energy
-Iterate the program, so that animals move randomnly
until they come within a certain radius of food, based on their energy they eat
-plants grow randomnly, animals can give birth within given age and energy
-put 30 iterations of the life cygle

ISSUS TO TAKE CARE OF
-From location, find range of movement
-check select locations, eat if possible, otherwise stick to simple ol' move


locate function, just in case, for later

*****************************************
//find location on a 3x3 grid and then move from there
public int getLocation()
{
    //works for the most part
    //sometimes the program doesn't run for some weird reason I can't figure out

    //starts at 0, then narrows down
    int location = 0;

    //start at the edges
    //if an extreme case, will fall unedr other if statements

    //positions
    // | 1 || 2 || 3 |
    // | 8 || 0 || 4 |
    // | 7 || 6 || 5 |

    //returns 0, if nothing hits, it can move anywhere

    //left side
    if(this.y_cord == 0)
    {
        location = 8;
    }

    //right side
    if(this.y_cord == 15)
    {
        location = 4;
    }

    //top edge, x = 0
    if(this.x_cord == 0)
    {
        location = 2;

        //check for two corner cases
        //top left corner
        if(this.y_cord == 0)
