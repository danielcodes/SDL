Some insight on the project

Virtual Environment
-a 2D plane, 32x32
-four types of objects, herbivore, carnivore, plant and obstacles
-program runs, # of objects of each type
-herbivore eats plants, carnivore eats herbivore
-animals and plants have age, only animals have energy
-can die if there isn't enough energy
-Iterate the program, so that animals move randomnly
until they come within a certain radius of food, based on their energy they eat
-plants grow randomnly, animals can give birth within given age and energy
-put 30 iterations of the life cygle

ISSUS TO TAKE CARE OF
-putting objects randomnly in the grid
-create a "grass" default
